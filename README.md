# Advent of Code 2024 - Solutions in Rust

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenge.

## Running the tests
```bash
cargo test
```

## Workflow
Simply place your input files in the `inputs` directory using the format `inputs/dayxx/input.txt` and run the tests.
The tests will most likely fail, since they are tailed to my input files.
Thankfully cargo will provide you with the expected output, which you can then paste into the test files.
